  ## Description
  This restful crud api is a nosql mongodb application  where users can share their TwoCents with other like minded individuals. This is purely a back end application to test implementation of our mongodb skills. I had fun with this challenge, especially creating the reactions, as those were the most challenging part of the project, along with testing out all of the routes in Insomnia.
